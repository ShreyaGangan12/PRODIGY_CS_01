# PRODIGY_CS_01
This project is part of the Prodigy InfoTech Python Programming Internship. It focuses on implementing the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a simple encryption technique used to secure textual messages by shifting letters in the alphabet. The task involves building a Python program that can both encrypt (inscript) and decrypt (descript) messages based on a user-provided shift value. Users are prompted to enter a message and a shift number, after which the program applies the Caesar Cipher logic to transform the text. The implementation handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, while leaving spaces and non-alphabetic characters unchanged. This project reinforces concepts such as string manipulation, control flow, and modular arithmetic, providing hands-on experience with basic cryptography in Python. The main goal is to help users understand how simple encryption works and how Python can be used to create interactive command-line tools.
